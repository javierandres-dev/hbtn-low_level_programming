## Learning Objectives
* What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* Basic usage of ```ar```, ```ranlib```, ```nm```

## Resources
* [What Is A “C” Library? What Is It Good For?](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#what_is_a_library)
* [Creating A Static “C” Library Using “ar” and “ranlib”](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#creating_static_archive)
* [Using A “C” Library In A Program](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#using_static_archive)
* [What is difference between Dynamic and Static library(Static and Dynamic linking)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW5he5uFBNM)
* [C static libraries](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/61)

## Tasks
* [x] 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
* [x] 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
* [ ] 2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
