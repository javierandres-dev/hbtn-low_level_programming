## Learning Objectives
###### General
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
###### More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
* ```O(1)```
* ```O(n)```
* ```O(n!)```
* n*m -> ```O(nm)```
* n square -> ```O(n^2)```
* sqrt n -> ```O(sqrt(n))```
* log(n) -> ```O(log(n))```
* n * log(n) -> ```O(nlog(n))```
* …
